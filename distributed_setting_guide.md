## What is GenderMag? <a name="introduction"></a>
GenderMag (short for Gender Inclusiveness Magnifier) is a method for finding gender-inclusiveness issues in software features. Software developers and/or user experience professionals can use it to evaluate their software products from a gender-inclusiveness lens. GenderMag does not advocate for "pink" and "blue" software, but instead gender-inclusive software. 

GenderMag uses 4 personas, each based on 5 key facets of problem-solving. Research spanning approximately 10 years found that these facets contain gender differences and have informed the GenderMag personas.

GenderMag then takes these personas and incorporates them into a cognitive walkthrough. Allowing software developers and UX professionals to look at and evaluate their software through the eyes of a persona.

## Roles, Rules and Common Errors <a name="paragraph1"></a>
### Roles: <a name="subparagraph1"></a>
The facilitator: Leads the team through the walkthrough and keeps it on track. Can also help to enforce rules and prevent counterproductive work. <br/>
The record-driver: Records the team's comments, results in the GenderMag forms and drives the prototype for the team. <br/>
Everyone: does the evaluation work. <br/><br/>

For a distributed session, only Record-driver will have write access on the computer (Everyone can see the screen)

### Rules: <a name="subparagraph2"></a>
Stay true to the persona: The team is looking to fix issues the persona might find, so really channel the persona. <br/>
Follow the "ideal" sequence: The persona might do something that is not part of the pre-made sequence but stick to the chosen sequence. <br/>
Answer every question: The team wants to gather as much information as they can, so don't leave anything out. <br/>
The team doesn't have to agree: But make sure the recorder writes down everyoneâ€™s comments. <br/>
Just find the issues: During the session is not the time to fix the issues, save that for after. <br/>
