			Abi leans towards a <i>comprehensive information processing style</i>when <span class="pronoun">they</span>
			need to gather information to problem-solve. That is, before following any option that seems promising,
			<span class="pronoun">Abi</span> first <span style="color:red;">gathers information comprehensively to try to form
			a complete understanding of the problem before trying to solve it</span>.Thus, <span class="possessive">their</span>
			style is “burst-y”; first <span class="pronoun">Abi</span> reads a lot, then <span class="pronoun">they</span>
			act on it in a batch of activity.
