		<span id="abiTToolTipComplete" hidden>
		Abi <span style="color:red;">doesn't particularly like tinkering with software</span> (ie, just trying out new features or commands to see what they do) when they use software in their work tasks.  Instead, they prefer <span style="color:red;"><u>following step-by-step tutorials and wizards.</u></span> (However, when they do tinker, it has positive effects on their understanding of the software.) When software features/commands cause problems for Abi, they <span style="color:red;"><u>tend to blame themselves</u></span> and, if they can, they then <span style="color:red;"><u>just avoid those troublesome features/commands.</u></span> Abi then uses work-arounds that involve using <span style="color:red;"><u>only features/commands they are familiar with already.</u></span>
