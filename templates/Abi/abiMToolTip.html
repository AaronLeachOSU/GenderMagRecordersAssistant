			Abi is <span style="color:red;"><u>proficient with the technologies they use.</u></span> Abi learns new technologies when they need to, but they donâ€™t spend her free time exploring technology or obscure functionality of programs and devices that they use. When Abi uses computers to problem-solve, they have <span style="color:red;"><u>little desire to learn new functions</u></span>, or to search for information on them. Abi tries to use methods they are <span style="color:red;"><u>already familiar and comfortable with</u></span> to achieve their goals.
