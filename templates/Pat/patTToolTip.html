		When Pat sees a need to learn new technology, they <span style="color:red;"><u>do so by trying out new features</u></span> or commands to see what they do and to understand how the software works. When they do this, they <span style="color:red;"><u>do so purposefully; that is, they reflect on each bit of feedback they get</u></span> along the way to understand how the feature might benefit them. Eventually, if they don't think it will get them closer to what they want to achieve, they will <span style="color:red;"><u>revert back to ways that they already know will work.</u></span></span>
