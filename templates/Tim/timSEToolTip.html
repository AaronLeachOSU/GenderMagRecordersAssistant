            Tim is <span style="color:red;"><u>very confident in his abilities with technology,</u></span> and thinks he’s better than the average person at learning about new features.  He doesn’t give up easily when computers or technology present a challenge to him. He will spend hours reading the manual so he can configure something to do exactly what he wants to do. <span style="color:red;"><u>If he can’t fix the problem, he blames it on the software vendor</u></span>; it’s not his fault if he can’t get it to work.
