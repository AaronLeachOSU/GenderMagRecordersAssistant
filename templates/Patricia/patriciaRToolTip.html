	Pat is <span style="color:red;"><u>risk averse</u></span> when they use computers to perform tasks. When confronted with new software features, Pat worries that they will spend time on them and not get any benefits from doing so. They prefer to perform tasks "the safe" (ie, familiar) way if possible, even if less familiar features might promise a more direct solution.
